# curve25519-uwp
An implementation of curve 25519, ported from on curve25519-java [https://github.com/WhisperSystems/curve25519-java].

This is a C++ WinRT component, suitable for use in UWP projects on Windows 10.

Take a look at the unit tests to see how to generate public and private keys. A NuGet package is in the works...
